<h1>Fiurycoin Unleashed[FIURY]</h1>

Fiurycoin is a Bitcoin v0.21 fork with modified block parameters. Fiurycoin Core is an open source software that allows anyone to operate a node in the Fiurycoin blockchain network and uses the Scrypt algorithm for Proof of Work mining.

Fiurycoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Fiurycoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Fiurycoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Fiurycoin Core software, see https://fiurycoin.online

Ports
=====================================

Fiurycoin Core by default uses port `12132` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `6537` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.
